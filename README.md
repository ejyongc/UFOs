# UFOs

## Overview

In this project, we have created an interactive website that allows us to filter through UFO sighting data. 

We introduced javaScript to sections of our HTML code  to create interactive filters and tables that allows us to filter through the data based on 5 differnt criterias: Date, Country, State, City, and UFO shape). 

## Results

As we introduce this website, we like to highlight some of the functionality of the website. We have created five interactive filters on the left hand side of the page that helps drill data down to the date, location, and shape of the UFO sighting.

With this five filters the user can specify the *date* they'd like to review. We have also provided three other filter criterias that allows the user to select the *country, state, and city* they like to research. Finally the user can speficy the shape the UFO at sight. 

Here is an example of a very specific search where the user filtered the data to find UFO sightings in the shape of a triangle in the state of Califirnia during January 10th 2010.

## Summary

This report has allowed users to filter and find very specific infomation about UFO sightings. As we obtain feedback from users on what kind of data they'd like to see, we'd like to also add elements of our interactive page to help users on their research, for example: 

1. We'd like to add a section on the page that provides total count and basic statistics of the data they just filtered for. For example we'd like to see the total count tof UFO sights when we filter for a specific date or location. 
2. The second element we'd like to add to the page is a visualization tool like a map. We believe that a map can help us visualize concentrations of UFO sightings and it can also be overlayered with other points of interests.
